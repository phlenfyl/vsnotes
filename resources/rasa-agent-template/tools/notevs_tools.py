"""Shared Maestro tools for the NoteVs agent.

Thin async wrappers around the NoteVs VS Code extension's local HTTP server's
plain REST endpoint (POST /call — see extension/src/mcpServer.ts). That
endpoint already implements all 10 tool handlers and is reused as-is by the
classic-CALM build (via /mcp JSON-RPC) and the Claude Code/Cursor stdio
bridge (mcpBridge.ts) — /call is the simplest of the three transports, a
same-machine JSON POST with no MCP session negotiation needed, so that's
what these wrappers use.

folderPath IS now sent (2026-08-18, reversing the note below): with several
VS Code windows open at once, each running its own agent, mcpServer.ts's
fixed port (37492) means only one window's HTTP server ever actually wins
the bind — every window's tool calls land on that one winner regardless of
which window's chat sent them. Omitting folderPath let resolveFolderPath()
fall back to *that* winner's own vscode.workspace.workspaceFolders[0],
so every window silently saw whichever project happened to own the port —
confirmed live as an agent returning a completely different project's note
titles. resolveFolderPath already prefers an explicit args.folderPath over
that fallback, so sending it here fixes correctness regardless of which
physical server instance answers, without needing to touch the port at
all. NOTEVS_FOLDER_PATH is set per-window by agentProcess.ts from that
window's own getFolderPath() at spawn time.
[Historical note, no longer current: "folderPath is deliberately never
sent... Maestro tools have no equivalent of the classic engine's flow-level
cwd to forward anyway." — true that Maestro doesn't thread it through the
conversation, but the process's own env var doesn't need to be threaded
through anything; it's static for that window's whole session.]
